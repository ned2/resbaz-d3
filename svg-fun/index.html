          <p>This is an SVG image generated using
            a <a href="https://github.com/ned2/resbaz-d3/blob/master/svg-fun/svg.py">Python
            script</a>. The image contains a bunch of triangles which
            have been placed around a circle every ~137.5 degrees with
            the distance of each triangle from the centre increasing
            proportionally to its position in the series of
            triangles. The approximate value of 137.5 degrees is
            derived from &Phi; (1.618..., ie the golden mean) in the
            following way: 360 - (360/&Phi;) &asymp; 137.5. This might remind
            you of the pattern found in various natural places, such
            as sunflowers. In the case of the sunflower, its producing
            little bud things in concentric spirals using the golden
            mean was arrived at by no coincidence, as it results in a
            particularly efficient way to pack the bud things. This is
            because &Phi; is an irrational number, resulting in an angle
            that yields minimal alignment of bud things.
          </p>
          <p>The following illustrates this using different values for
            the angle used to produce the bud things.</p>

        <div class="description">
          <h2>120&deg;</h2>
          <p>A pathological value of the angle. 120 divides neatly
            into into 360, so every 120&deg; around the circle, the
            bud things overlap.</p>

        <div class="description">
          <h2>121&deg;</h2>
          <p>We can improve things by adding 1, resulting in less
            overlap and also a pretty spiral. But there's still quite
            a lot of wasted space between the arms of the spiral.</p>

          <h2>137.5&deg;</h2>
          <p>Using this value, which is an approximation of the actual
          golden angle derived from &Phi;, we can see that we get
          excellent efficiency. (The first image up above uses an even
          closer approximation, resulting in slightly more
          efficiency.)</p>

          <p>Interestingly, varying the angle only slightly yields
          noticeably less efficient packing.</p>

          <p>The idea for the Fibonacci generator came
            from <a href="http://goldenspiral.sennep.com/">here</a>,
            which has a neat interactive interface where you can explore
            the impact of large and small changes in the angle. This is
            not really feasible here as the images are generated on the
            server. I guess a client-size visualisation library would
            come in handy here... You can view the source for the Python
            script <a href="https://github.com/ned2/resbaz-d3/blob/master/svg-fun/svg.py">here</a>.</p>
