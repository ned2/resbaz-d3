    <h1 class="title">SVG Fun with Phi</h1>

    <div class="example">
      <div class="description">
        <p>This is an SVG image generated using a Python script. The
          image contains a bunch of triangles which have been placed
          around a circle every ~137.5 degrees with the distance of
          each triangle from the centre increasing proportionally to
          its position in the series. The approximate value of 137.5
          degrees is derived from phi (1.618..., ie the golden mean)
          in the following way: 360 - (360/phi) ≈ 137.5. This might
          remind you of the pattern found in various natural places,
          such as sunflowers. In the case of the sunflower, it
          producing little bud things in concentric spirals using the
          golden mean was arrived at by no coincidence, as it results
          in a particularly efficient way to pack the bud things. This
          is because phi is an irrational number
          
          which is an irrational number like this way will result in a
          particularly efficient use of space, because phi is an
          irrational number.

        <p>The following illustrates this using different values for
          the angle used to produce the bud things.</p>

        <p>The idea for the Fibonacci generator came
          from <a href="http://goldenspiral.sennep.com/">here</a>,
          which has a neat interactive interface where you can explore
          the impact of large and small changes in the angle. This is
          not really feasible here as the images are generated on the
          server. I guess a client-size visualisation library would
          come in handy here... You can view the source for the Python
          script <a href="https://github.com/ned2/resbaz-d3/blob/master/svg-fun/svg.py">here</a>.</p>
